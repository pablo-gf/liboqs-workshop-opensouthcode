# liboqs Workshop @ OpenSouthCode

Welcome to the hands-on workshop for **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** using the [Open Quantum Safe (liboqs)](https://openquantumsafe.org/) library and its Python wrapper! This repository is designed for the OpenSouthCode event and provides practical exercises and collaborative activities to help you understand and experiment with quantum-resistant cryptography.

## Overview
This workshop introduces:
- The basics of post-quantum cryptography
- The liboqs C library and its Python wrapper (liboqs-python)
- How to use quantum-safe Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signatures
- Building authenticated, quantum-secure communication protocols

You will learn by doing, with step-by-step instructions and interactive exercises in a Jupyter notebook.

## What You'll Do
- **Install and build** liboqs and liboqs-python
- **Generate and exchange quantum-safe keys** (KEMs)
- **Sign and verify messages** with quantum-safe digital signatures
- **Collaborate** with other participants to exchange encrypted messages and verify signatures
- **Implement a full quantum-secure protocol** using NIST-standardized algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA)

## Workshop Structure
- **Introduction to liboqs and liboqs-python**
